    Primitive:
      type: string
      description: >-
        JSON-LD does not support to attach a `@context` to a primitive type,
        and the x-jsonld-type would be something like `rdfs:Literal`, that
        bears no semantic information.
    Array:
      type: array
      description: >-
        JSON-LD does not support to attach a `@context` to a primitive type,

            Without `x-jsonld-context`,
            [JSON-LD Framing](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-framing/)
            cannot use any `@context` to resolve properties.
      example:
        givenName: John
    TypeUseContext1:
      type: object
      x-jsonld-type: Person
      x-jsonld-context:
        "@vocab": "https://w3id.org/italia/onto/CPV/"
      description: >-
        The associated rdf:type is inferred from @vocab.
        The editor shows only the rdf:type information,
        since we have no properties.

        Resulting RDF is:

        ```turtle
        _:b0 a <https://w3id.org/italia/onto/CPV/Person> .
        ```
      # Use an empty object to enable the JSON-LD playground.
      example: {}
    TypeUsesContext2:
      type: object
      x-jsonld-type: RPO:RegisteredResidentPerson
      x-jsonld-context:

            The associated rdf:Property is inferred from @vocab.
            The editor shows the retrieved information.
            Resulting RDF is:
